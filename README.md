For the local multiplayer process the idea of room is used. First, create a room. Then ask your friends (up to 3) to connect to your room (they must enter ), and then start. 

The main aim is to destroy all other cars. You can gather bonuses, such as Sword (temporary shooting faster), Shield (temporary immunity), Medkit (+1 heart of health, if not full).
Use arrows to control your car.
